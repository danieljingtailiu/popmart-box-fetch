## üéØ What This Bot Does

PopMart Unified Bot is a smart automation system that monitors PopMart products and handles checkout automatically. It works with **both regular products and PopNow mystery box sets**, automatically detecting which type you're monitoring without any configuration needed.

### üß† **Smart Features**
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatically figures out if you're monitoring regular products or PopNow sets
- **Lightning-Fast Monitoring**: Uses advanced techniques to catch restocks the moment they happen
- **Dual Browser System**: Separate browsers for monitoring and checkout for maximum speed
- **Crash-Resistant**: Built to handle errors gracefully and keep running
- **Works with LABUBU**: Yes, it works with LABUBU products too (though competition is fierce!)

## ‚ö° **Speed & Performance**

### **Monitoring Speed**
- **100ms checks**: Monitors every 0.1 seconds for instant detection
- **Triple monitoring**: Uses MutationObserver + Polling + Animation Frame for maximum coverage
- **Instant restock detection**: Catches the exact moment stock becomes available

### **Checkout Speed**
- **PopNow products**: ~2 seconds from detection to payment page
- **Regular products**: ~3-4 seconds from detection to payment page
- **Pre-warmed browsers**: Checkout browser stays logged in and ready

## üõ†Ô∏è **Installation & Setup**

### **Requirements**
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Chrome browser
- PopMart account

### **Quick Start**
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/popmart-unified-bot.git
cd popmart-unified-bot

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install seleniumbase

# 3. Run the bot
python main.py
```

That's it! No configuration files needed. The bot will:
1. Ask you to login to PopMart in the checkout browser
2. Show you available products from `popmart_products.json`
3. Let you choose which products to monitor
4. Start monitoring automatically

## üì¶ **Supported Products**

The bot automatically detects product types from your `popmart_products.json` file:

### **Current Products** (from popmart_products.json)
- **Regular Products**: THE MONSTERS series, HIRONO figures, Baby Molly & Tabby
- **PopNow Sets**: THE MONSTERS mystery boxes (IDs: 293, 170)

### **Adding New Products**
Just add them to `popmart_products.json`:
```json
{
  "YOUR_PRODUCT_ID": {
    "name": "Product Name",
    "url": "https://www.popmart.com/ca/products/YOUR_PRODUCT_ID/"
  }
}
```

The bot will automatically detect if it's a regular product or PopNow set based on the URL.

## üö® **Competition Reality Check**

### **LABUBU & High-Demand Releases**
- **This bot works with LABUBU** ‚úÖ
- **But competition is intense** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- API-based bots can checkout in <1 second
- This browser-based bot takes ~2-4 seconds
- **Still worth trying** - many people succeed!

### **Best Success Rates**
- **PopNow mystery boxes**: Good success rate
- **Regular restocks**: Very good success rate  
- **Less popular characters**: Excellent success rate
- **LABUBU new releases**: Challenging but possible

### **Why This Bot Still Works**
- **Instant detection**: Catches restocks immediately
- **Reliable**: Doesn't crash like many other bots
- **Human-like**: Harder for PopMart to detect
- **Dual browser**: Checkout browser stays ready
